/**
 * Older versions of Yarn didn't handle npm_package_config:
 *
 *   https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2989
 *
 * We have a new version installed under vendor/bin/, but it's possible people
 * may invoke their globally installed, potentially older version of
 * yarn instead.
 *
 * As such, for the few package.json scripts which *must* be run with `npm`
 * rather than `yarn`, this module detects running under `yarn` in those cases
 * and shells out to `npm` to do the equivalent setting of environment
 * variables.
