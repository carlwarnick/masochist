// Want to be able to collapse ~~wave function~~ DFA from
// not-really-deterministic-FA to actually-deterministic-FA.
// eg. given /foobar|foobaz/
// want to collapse
//            /f--o--o--b--a--r
//     [start]
//            \f--o--o--b--a--z
// to:
//                          /-r
//     [start]-f--o--o--b--a
//                          \-z
// (ie. merge common prefix)
// same for common suffix
// which we can do by merging identical states
// -- how do we know if they are identical?
// well, i want to say, if they have the same transition condition, the DFA-ness
// of it means they must lead to "the same place"
// as in, even though "f" leads to both "foobar" and "foobaz", eventually, the
// fact that we're producing a DFA means that, by definition, the initial "f"
// can be collapsed to be the same place, otherwise it wouldn't be a DFA
// i guess another way of saying that is that we collapse transitions, not
// states (and it ends up looking like the same thing).

// ie. we want a data structure that lends it self to this kind of
// transformation
// and also, once finished, we can straightforwardly use to generate code (ie. a
// switch statement) â€” that means we might need to go back and add state numbers
// after the fact in a separate pass
