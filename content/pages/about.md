Welcome to [wincent.com](/). My name is Greg Hurrell. I live in Spain. I work at [GitHub](https://github.com/) (for more detail, see [my CV](https://wincent.github.io/cv/cv-full.en.html)). This is my "technical" presence on the web ([greg.hurrell.net](http://greg.hurrell.net) is my non-technical one, which is for now just a collection of links to my various other presences on the web). Here I put [stuff that I feel like saying](/blog) and which might be of interest to other technical people, and [stuff which I may want to remember](/wiki).
