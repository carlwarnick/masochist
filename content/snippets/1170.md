On opening lid, password prompt was behaving as though Karabiner-Elements SpaceFN layer was jammed on. That is, if I hit "j", "k", "i", "l" etc (qwerty positions, that is), I could see the cursor moving left, down, up, right, respectively (where "down" moved the cursor to the end and "up" moved it to the start). But the space bar wasn't jammed down; I could type spaces. I tried to kill Karabiner-Elements with Fn+Control+Option+Command+Z, but sadly it didn't work... [Hard reset](/wiki/Hard_reset). Upon rebooting I could see why the kill shortcut hadn't worked: a pesky permissions dialog pops up asking whether it's ok for Karabiner-Elements to control the Terminal app... sigh... I said "allow", but it may end up asking for those perms again in the future after any update (to the OS or to the app). Would be nice to figure out a way to do this without involving the terminal itself... This would be my most reliable machine by far if it weren't for these Karabiner-Elements issues; looking at the list of 16 failures, as many as 10 of them look to be Karabiner-Elements-related. If it weren't for those, we could have an average time between failures as high as 231.33 days, which would be spectacular (even with the keyboard-related failures, the current average of 86.75 is still not too shabby, and second-highest ranked machine out of the 13 machines since I started keeping records).
