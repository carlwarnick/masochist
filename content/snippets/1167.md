Not sure what happened here; I was away for an hour and when I came back the machine appeared to be off (non-responsive to Touch ID or closing/re-opening the lid). Additionally, the power switch didn't seem to do anything. I plugged it into its power adapter (it had been plugged into its dock) and it immediately booted. Battery was fully charged, so it's not that the battery drained while plugged into the dock. Nothing in the system logs gives an obviously clue to what went wrong.
