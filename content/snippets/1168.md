Machine was powered on with screen on but I wasn't actively using it (and hadn't touched it for a while, either) when it had a spontaneous [kernel panic](/wiki/Kernel_panic). My first thought was that some corp-management process must have done something shady in the background, but there is no obvious evidence in the diagnostic report, a small excerpt of which is:

```
panic(cpu 1 caller 0xfffffe0020e0b624): "AppleANS3NVMeController::setPowerState(0xfffffe2332d80000 : 0xfffffe0022a7bda4, 0 -> 1) timed out after 101636 ms"

```

I thought I could recover uptime info from those timestamps but I don't know what they correspond to; they don't seem to be UNIX timestamps (since 1970), nor HFS+ timestamps (since 1904), nor "Mac absolute" Cocoa timestamps (since 2001).
